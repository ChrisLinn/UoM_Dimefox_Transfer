# UoM_Dimefox_Transfer

__Tired__ of memorizing `dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au`?

__Tired__ of typing `dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au`?

Prefer _console_ to _FileZilla_?

Prefer _typing_ to _clicking_?

## Usage
```
. lazyTransfer.sh <FILE>
```

And you can also connect to `dimefox` from now on by
```
ssh enguom
```
Even if you don't have anything to transfer.
